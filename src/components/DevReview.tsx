        <p>
          Besides a lack of more advanced features, the key take-away from this project is a need to find a more
          appropriate way of styling DOM elements. Naming conventions are inconsistent, some of which are 
          too vague, and the layout is at best a rough structure of header-body-footer stylings. 
        </p>
          <p>Even so, I think using SASS would be at least worth a shot for future frontend applications. </p>
